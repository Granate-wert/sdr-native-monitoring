# APP-06A: common catalog joins and pre-SDK request compatibility

This is source-level integration into the existing backend for **UI V2**.
It is not completed multi-family Analyzer selection, a common hardware owner,
frozen-package qualification, calibration acceptance or APP-06 completion.
Neither a catalog entry nor an accepted compatibility result authorizes RX.

## One set of facts, explicit identity namespaces

The existing `DeviceCapabilitySnapshot` remains the capability truth model.
The existing `DeviceCalibrationIdentity` remains the adapter/device/firmware
identity used by later calibration/correction gates. An optional, evidenced
`model_id` is an adapter discriminator, not a parsed human-readable label.
HackRF board kind and tinySA Basic/Ultra come from their typed read-only
observations; AD936x ranges continue to come from the actual observation,
including modified firmware, rather than a hard-coded chip-name ceiling.

`DeviceCapabilityBinding` joins an existing operational device/source ID to
those same immutable references. It does not rename operational IDs, frames,
recordings or acquisition epochs into the canonical SHA-256 namespace.
Both canonical references must exist together and agree on family, adapter
and identity key. Unknown-serial routes remain operational candidates, with
neither a stable physical key nor calibration identity claim.

`DeviceCapabilityInventory` now additionally contains bindings and independent
`AdapterRuntimeSnapshot` observations. Each collection has the existing finite
device bound; iterable consumption stops at bound+1. Lookup and exact merge
perform no discovery, SDK load, owner construction, configuration or RX.
Exact duplicate inventories are idempotent. Conflicting capabilities, firmware
identities, operational IDs, adapter families or runtime facts are rejected,
not replaced by a last-write-wins policy. Providers must resolve aliases before
merge; merge cannot infer aliases from labels, addresses or equal ranges.

## Runtime facts are not hardware-support facts

`UNKNOWN`, `UNAVAILABLE` and `AVAILABLE` describe an observed adapter contract
surface. They are independent from physical capabilities. An available contract
does not prove driver/DLL closure, a selected device, a specific acquisition
mode, transport throughput, RF-path validity or frozen EXE acceptance.
An absent runtime observation stays unknown, not an unsupported-device claim.

NativeLive observes the already loaded AD936x surface only: exact integer
observation protocol1, identity admission protocol1 and callable device/fixed
band factories. It makes no new SDK call to populate this runtime reference.
HackRF/tinySA observation and runtime providers still need the common retained
catalog/owner integration; a capability mapper alone cannot invent availability.

## Pure family compatibility, not an activation plan

`admit_source_request()` uses an explicit operational binding, canonical facts,
runtime observation, mode and the existing family-specific request types.
Its immutable result contains a finite refusal reason or compatibility success.
It is **not** a Start permit, issued native activation plan, device readback,
applied setting, RF proof or hardware-continuity guarantee. Subsequent family
owners retain identity, geometry, backend, budget, epoch and cleanup gates.

| Source | RTBW request | Sweep request | Important boundary |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AD936x | Existing `LiveConfiguration`; finite numeric center/Fs/gain/BW, observed ranges | Existing `ContinuousSweepPlanRequest` plus applied profile; one observed tuning range, usable window <= Fs/RF BW | Native geometry/backend/memory/serial revalidation still follow |
| HackRF | Existing `HackrfLiveRequest`; own LNA/VGA/filter and provenance gates | `mode_runtime_unavailable` in this integration slice | Missing host strategy is not a hardware-impossible claim; no Pluto gain translation |
| tinySA Basic/Ultra | `device_mode_unsupported` for complex-I/Q RTBW | Existing bounded `TinySaScanRawRequest`, observed model and one valid input range | Device-reported dBm, no raw I/Q/host FFT; input/settings/readback still follow |

Missing identity, range or transport evidence is reported as unverified, not
as a frequency error or confirmed unsupported hardware. tinySA input ranges
are not stitched into one unsupported command. Existing product limits remain
10001 points and 30005 scanraw frame bytes; higher requests are not enabled.
The external correction identity stays separate from device-reported built-in
dBm calibration; no second dBFS conversion or calibration is applied here.

## Existing product paths connected to the guard

NativeLive discovery and route selection retain snapshot and calibration
identity from the **same** already-owned read-only observation. Selection
refreshes firmware/ranges without mutating prior inventories. Serial-based
USB/IP grouping cannot publish a canonical aggregate when firmware or
non-transport capability facts disagree, even if serial and ranges match.
Failed observation cleanup continues to block catalog access and new owners.

For known canonical AD936x devices, `start_admitted()` refuses incompatibility
before dispatch and without changing Live state or taking cleanup ownership.
Raw `start()` also refuses before SDK factory access. The exact immutable
profile used by Start is rechecked after any error-engine recovery and reused
for applied/readback publication; an earlier check cannot validate a later
replacement profile. Explicit unverified routes keep their previous owner
compatibility, but finite scalar validation still precedes factory access.
They do not silently become admitted stable catalog entries.

The stopped CPU Sweep lease captures immutable catalog/profile facts. Its
optional typed validator is called by continuous Sweep preflight before native
segment/configuration/coordinator construction. A refused Start releases the
logical lease without opening a receiver. It does not consult changing Live
configuration. Older explicit/fake leases may omit this callback; that
compatibility is not evidence of stable canonical admission. Existing Sweep
geometry, backend, resource and actual owner checks remain mandatory.

All additions are low-rate control-plane work. No per-FFT catalog rebuild,
new render lane, sample copying, hidden restart, native wire-schema change or
performance claim is introduced.

## Required further work

The common retained provider registry, integrated UI V2 source selector,
family-specific controls and one owner/router still remain. HackRF/tinySA
compatibility tests do not establish their selectable V2 product paths.
Official shared-DLL/frozen packaging and actual high-Fs device/transport cells
also remain separate acceptance gates. APP-05 performance debts, APP-06A/B,
APP-06C/D, APP-07 and release acceptance are not closed by this source packet.
